# Twitter Context Annotations

This repository contains flat files of the available context entities supported by the [Tweet Annotations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/annotations/overview) feature of the API. The files contain a list of entities encompassed by the 80+ supported domains that have annotated Tweets in the past few months â€“ we consider these to be "active" entity annotations. Two files are provided, each representing a different category of entities:

1. Evergreen entities - non event-based entities that are always "on" and annotating Tweets.
2. Event-based entities - entities that only annotate for a distinct period of time. Examples include TV episodes, sporting events, etc.

Feel free to download the files in this repository to discover the extent of available context annotation entities.
